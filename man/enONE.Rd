\arguments{
\item{object}{Enone object.}

\item{n.neg.control}{Number of negative control genes for RUV normalization.}

\item{n.pos.eval}{Number of positive evaluation genes for wanted variation assessment.}

\item{n.neg.eval}{Number of negative evaluation genes for unwanted variation assessment.}

\item{scaling.method}{Vector of normalization methods that are applied to the data.
Available methods are: \code{c("TC", "UQ", "TMM", "DESeq")}.
Select one or multiple methods. By default all normalization methods will be applied.}

\item{ruv.norm}{Whether to perform RUV normalization.}

\item{ruv.k}{The number of factors of unwanted variation to be estimated from the data.}

\item{ruv.drop}{The number of singular values to drop in the estimation of
unwanted variation, default drop the first singular value that represent the
difference between enrichment and input.}

\item{pam_krange}{Integer or vector of integers indicates the number of
clusters for PAM clustering, default: 2:6.}

\item{pc_k}{Integer indicates the metrics will be calculated in the first kth PCs, default: 3.}
